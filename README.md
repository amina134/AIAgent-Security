Project Overview

This project implements an AI-powered security agent for Django applications. The agent proactively blocks and prevents security vulnerabilities by analyzing API requests in real-time and enforcing automated security controls. Using LLM-based threat intelligence, it detects malicious patterns, applies WAF-like protections, and mitigates potential attacks before they reach the application.
